## Project run

To run this project you will need to have **Python** installed on your computer. The first thing we will do is download the project and open it in our preferred editor. Although not required, it is recommended that you create a **virtual environment** to store your project dependencies separately.

To install a **virtual environment**, run the following command:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

If your operating system is **Windows**, open **"Command Prompt"** and run the following command:

```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

If your operating system is **Linux** or **Mac**, open **"Terminal"** and run:

```
source env/bin/activate
```

Next, install the project dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is almost ready, now it only remains to execute the project with the following command:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
